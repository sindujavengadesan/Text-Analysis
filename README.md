Mapping the Landscape of Generative AI Research through Web of Science

**Tasks**

1. Comprehensive Literature Retrieval (30 points): Leverage the Web of Science database to systematically search for and retrieve publications related to generative AI. This will involve defining a set of search terms that effectively capture the scope of generative AI, including but not limited to terms like "generative adversarial networks", “generative AI”

2. Keyword Co-Occurrence Network Analysis (30 points): Build a keyword co-occurrence network from the author keywords associated with the retrieved publications. This network will visually represent how different research themes in generative AI are interconnected, highlighting the most frequently mentioned and central keywords.

3. Identification of Key Research Themes (40 points): Analyze the keyword co-occurrence network using the weighted network analysis. This will help in understanding the focus areas of current research and predicting future trends.
